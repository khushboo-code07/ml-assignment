The following prerequisites of matlab command/methodology are needed to complete this exercise.

●	How to import data into matlab from .txt file (Matlab command : load, csvread)
●	How to find size and length of the matrix (Matlab command : size, length)
●	Creating matrix with all zeros or ones (Matlab command: zeros, ones)
●	Adding one column of one’s to a existing matrix 
●	Element-wise operation in matrix. Eg: Multiplying all elements in a vector by 2
●	Subtracting of two matrix
●	Summation of all elements in a vector (Matlab command: sum)
●	Plot/visualisation of data in matlab (Matlab command: plot, surf, contour)
●	Functions in matlab (similar to functions in C language, read the syntax)
●	How to segregate/form a smaller matrix from larger matrix (eg: from 3 x 3 matrix, create 3 x 2 matrix, considering only first two columns)
